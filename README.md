# JS-to-TS-Synthesis Pipeline

This utility provides an easy way to generate (partial) type definitions for an existing javascript library.

## Motivation

TypeScript is a new variant of JavaScript that adds *optional* static types. Type annotations in TS can
make programming in JavaScript feel much more productive and less error prone. But to use an
off-the-shelf JS library in your TS project, you currently need to write the typing annotations by hand.
This can be a painful process: you have to understand how a library works and cook up a new design for
its types from scratch.
The goal of this project is to generate these typing shims automatically. It would work by running the
libraryâ€™s test suite while observing its inputs and outputs.

## How to Run

```
npm install https://github.com/cucapra/js-to-ts-synthesis
npm run build
bin/ts-pipeline.js --repo (path to repo) --dir (the working directory)
```

The pipeline will clone the repo into the working directory and instrument its tests. Using the information from the library's inputs and outputs, it will generate a .d.ts definition file next to every library function.
Furthermore, a test file will be generated that captures the type deducer's picture of each function's input and output space. To see more options, run `bin/ts-pipeline.js --help`.
